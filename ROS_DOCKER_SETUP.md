# Shared ROS 2 Course Environment

Set this environment up **once** and reuse it for every ROS-based lab:

- Week 1: ROS foundations
- Week 3: motion, frames, and AI-assisted development
- Week 6: SLAM and localization
- Week 8: computer vision and learned perception
- Week 9: planning and navigation
- Week 11: HRI evaluation

Weeks 4, 5, 10, 12, and 14 are self-contained Python labs and do not require this container.

## What the container provides

The course image contains Ubuntu 24.04, ROS 2 Jazzy, TurtleBot3 simulation, Gazebo, RViz, TF tools, SLAM Toolbox, Navigation2, OpenCV/image tools, colcon, and the shared Streamlit/Python environment.

ROS, Gazebo, RViz, and the terminal run in one Linux container. A browser-based Linux desktop avoids different X11 instructions on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

```text
Browser
├── http://localhost:6080  Linux desktop, terminals, Gazebo, RViz
└── http://localhost:8501 Active lab's Streamlit guide
                         ↓
              shared ROS 2 Jazzy container
                         ↓
              repository mounted at /workspace
```

The ports bind only to `127.0.0.1`; the noVNC desktop is not exposed to the local network.

## Requirements

- A 64-bit Windows, macOS, or Linux computer with hardware virtualization enabled
- At least 8 GB RAM; 16 GB is recommended for Gazebo + RViz
- Approximately 12 GB free disk space for Docker, the image, and build artifacts
- Git
- Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS, or Docker Engine plus the Compose plugin on Linux

Docker Desktop supports Windows and both Intel and Apple-silicon Macs. On Windows, use the WSL 2 Linux-container backend. See the official [Windows WSL setup](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/wsl/), [Windows installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/), and [macOS installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).

The image begins with the official multi-architecture `ros:jazzy-ros-base-noble` image, which is published for AMD64 and ARM64. This avoids AMD64 emulation on Apple silicon. See the official [ROS image tags](https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/tags).

## 1. Install Docker once

### Windows 10/11

1. Install current Windows updates.
2. In an Administrator PowerShell window, run `wsl --install`, then restart if requested.
3. Install Docker Desktop for Windows.
4. In Docker Desktop, select **Use the WSL 2 based engine** and **Linux containers**.
5. Start Docker Desktop and wait for the engine to report that it is running.
6. Verify in PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --version
docker version
docker compose version
```

### macOS: Intel or Apple silicon

1. Install the Docker Desktop download matching the Mac's chip.
2. Start Docker Desktop and finish its first-run prompts.
3. Verify in Terminal:

```bash
docker version
docker compose version
```

### Linux

Install Docker Engine and the Docker Compose plugin using Docker's instructions for the distribution. Complete Docker's Linux post-install steps if commands should run without `sudo`. Verify:

```bash
docker version
docker compose version
```

Use Docker Engine on Linux rather than Docker Desktop unless the institution specifically manages Docker Desktop.

## 2. Fork and clone the course repository once

Use a personal GitHub fork for your coursework. Your fork gives you a repository where you can commit and push your own lab submissions. The instructor repository remains the source for new and revised labs.

### Create your fork

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Open <https://github.com/RajKorpan/robotics-fall2026>.
3. Select **Fork**.
4. Keep the repository name `robotics-fall2026` and create the fork under your own account.
5. On your fork's page, select **Code** and copy its HTTPS URL.

Clone your fork. Replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/robotics-fall2026.git
cd robotics-fall2026
```

In this clone, `origin` points to your fork. Add the instructor repository as a second remote named `upstream`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/RajKorpan/robotics-fall2026.git
git remote -v
```

The output should show two remotes:

```text
origin    https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/robotics-fall2026.git
upstream  https://github.com/RajKorpan/robotics-fall2026.git
```

- `origin` is your fork. Push your completed work here.
- `upstream` is the instructor repository. Download course updates from here.

### If you already cloned the instructor repository directly

Create your GitHub fork first. Then, from the existing local repository, rename the instructor remote and add your fork as `origin`:

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/robotics-fall2026.git
git remote -v
git push -u origin main
```

You do not need to clone a second copy after completing these steps.

## 3. Build the environment and all ROS workspaces once

The first run downloads/builds a large image and compiles all six workspaces. It can take 15 to 45 minutes depending on the computer and network.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ros_course.ps1 setup
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/ros_course.sh
./scripts/ros_course.sh setup
```

Successful setup ends with:

```text
All six ROS lab workspaces built successfully.
```

After setup succeeds, follow the README inside the assigned lab directory. Each lab README provides its launch command, lab-guide link, virtual-desktop link, and any lab-specific ROS commands.

## Everyday commands

| Task | Windows | macOS/Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Start container | `.\scripts\ros_course.ps1 start` | `./scripts/ros_course.sh start` |
| Rebuild workspaces | `.\scripts\ros_course.ps1 build` | `./scripts/ros_course.sh build` |
| Show status | `.\scripts\ros_course.ps1 status` | `./scripts/ros_course.sh status` |
| Stop container | `.\scripts\ros_course.ps1 stop` | `./scripts/ros_course.sh stop` |

Stopping the container does not delete source, submissions, maps, evidence, or workspace build output because the repository is mounted from the host.

## Updating during the semester

The instructor may revise later labs after you have completed an earlier lab. Keep the same local clone for the entire semester. Because each lab has its own directory, updates to a future lab will normally merge without changing your completed work.

### Before downloading an update

Your working tree must be clean. First save, commit, and push the lab you have been working on. For example, after Week 1:

```bash
git status
git add week01_ros_foundations
git commit -m "Complete Week 1 lab"
git push origin main
```

Run `git status` again. It should say `working tree clean` before you continue. Do not download course updates while you have uncommitted lab work.

### Download and merge instructor updates

From the repository root, run:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

These commands perform three separate jobs:

1. `git fetch upstream` downloads the instructor's latest commits without changing your files.
2. `git merge upstream/main` combines those course updates with your commits.
3. `git push origin main` sends the combined history to your GitHub fork.

Check the result:

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

Your earlier submission files and commits should remain present, and the revised future lab files should now be available.

### Rebuild after receiving course updates

Course updates may change Python code, ROS packages, launch scripts, or the Docker image. After merging an update, run the setup command again. Docker will reuse unchanged layers, so repeated setup is usually faster than the first setup.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\ros_course.ps1 setup
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
./scripts/ros_course.sh setup
```

Pure Python source changes in a symlink-built workspace usually do not require a rebuild, but running `build` is always safe.

### If Git reports a merge conflict

A conflict means both you and the instructor changed the same lines of the same file. Git will identify each conflicted file. Do not delete the repository, create a second clone, or use `git reset --hard`.

1. Run `git status` and note the files listed under **Unmerged paths**.
2. Open each listed file and look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers.
3. Preserve your completed work while incorporating the new course instructions or starter code.
4. Remove the conflict markers and save the file.
5. Mark the conflict resolved and complete the merge:

```bash
git add PATH-TO-RESOLVED-FILE
git commit -m "Merge instructor course updates"
git push origin main
```

If you are uncertain which version to keep, stop before committing and ask the instructor or teaching assistant for help. Include the output of `git status` and the name of the conflicted file.

### Semester update checklist

Use this sequence before starting each newly released lab:

```text
1. Finish the current lab.
2. Commit the current lab.
3. Push it to origin.
4. Confirm that git status is clean.
5. Fetch from upstream.
6. Merge upstream/main.
7. Push the merged history to origin.
8. Run the shared setup command.
9. Follow the new lab's README to start it.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker command cannot connect

Start Docker Desktop and wait for the engine. On Windows, confirm Docker is using Linux containers and WSL 2.

### `/usr/bin/env: 'bash\r': No such file or directory`

This means an older Windows checkout converted a Linux shell script to CRLF line endings. Download the latest course update and rerun the Windows `setup` command. The updated Docker build and lab launcher normalize these scripts automatically.

### Port 6080 or 8501 is already in use

Stop another course container or local Streamlit process, then run the course `stop` and `start` commands.

### Gazebo or RViz is slow

The default uses Mesa software rendering for consistent behavior across platforms. Close other memory-intensive applications and allocate more CPU/RAM to Docker Desktop. Native Ubuntu with hardware acceleration remains the supported performance fallback.

### Browser desktop is blank

Run the `status` command. If the container is running, refresh the noVNC URL. Otherwise run `stop`, then `start`.

### Rebuild only after source changes

Run the course `build` command. If package dependencies changed, rerun `setup` so the image is rebuilt.

### Reset the container without deleting coursework

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Do not add `--volumes`, and do not delete the repository. Student work lives in the mounted repository.

## Instructor: publish instead of local builds

The image can be published for both architectures so students pull identical layers:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -f docker/Dockerfile \
  -t ghcr.io/OWNER/robotics-fall2026:jazzy-v1 \
  --push .
```

Set `COURSE_ROS_IMAGE` to that tag before `docker compose up`. Pin a semester tag or digest; do not use an unversioned `latest` image for graded work. Validate Gazebo, RViz, TurtleBot3, SLAM, Nav2, OpenCV, and noVNC on Windows/AMD64, macOS/ARM64, and Linux/AMD64 before release.
